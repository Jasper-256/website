  <h1>Strobe Light Party FAQs & Support</h1>

  <h2>How do I connect multiple devices?</h2>
  <p>First, click "Join Strobe Light Party" on all the devices you want to connect. Then, on one device, click "Lead Party" and all the devices will automatically connect to the leader. Now, the flashlights on all of the devices will flash at the same time.</p>

  <h2>What does frequency mean?</h2>
  <p>Frequency is the number of times the strobe light turns on and off again in one second.</p>

  <h2>What is duty cycle?</h2>
  <p>Duty cycle is the percentage of time that the strobe light is on versus off during each strobe cycle. For example, a 25% duty cycle means the strobe light is on for a quarter of the cycle and off for the other three quarters.</p>

  <h2>What's the difference between strobe, invertable, and time slice mode?</h2>
  <p><strong>Strobe:</strong> In strobe mode, every device follows the same strobe pattern, synchronizing their flashes.</p>
  <p><strong>Invertable:</strong> This option allows connected devices to invert the strobe pattern compared to the device leading the party, so they will be off when the leading device is on.</p>
  <p><strong>Time Slice:</strong> In time slice mode, each strobe cycle is divided into a set number of time slices. Each device can select which slice their strobe is active in. The duty cycle in this mode represents the percentage of each slice that the strobe light is on versus off. The device leading the party is always in slice 1.</p>

  <h2>Why are my devices not connecting?</h2>
  <p>Devices might not connect for various reasons such as Wi-Fi being turned off, or the app encountering an issue. Sometimes, restarting the app can help resolve connection issues. Additionally, turning Wi-Fi off and back on again can also be an effective solution.</p>
